# EMER2GENT COVID-19

## Context 

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK, several significant measures have been taking in order to limit the number of new infections as much as possible. As the growth in COVID-19 deaths isdecreasing, the government is seeking to understand how to safely resume economic activity by potentially lifting (some of) these measures. As a result, the government is interested in understandingwhat impact the release of measures has on both health and economic outcomes. Given the diseases has been affecting countries in different periods of time, analysis of international comparators that have already released certain measures could provide helpful insights to plan release of measures in the UK.

Due to its political system, the response to the COVID outbreak in the US has been different from state-to-state. As such, the US provides a wide variety of types, timing and (non-)application of measures. A state-by-state analysis of the impact of enforcing and releasing measures on health and economic outcomes could therefore provide helpful insights to inform planning the release of measures in the UK.

In this Challenge, we are seeking US state data-backed suggestionsfor release of measures in the UK that allow economic activity to resume whilst minimising the risk of additional COVID-19 deaths.
